##### Black Mage
*Version 3*
The **Black Mage** is a low Health DPS unit with access to various ways of dealing with enemies and their cards through the use of Magic.
 - They have an MP resource that goes from 0-10 and have Spells that will require some amount of MP to be able to play them. MP is only spent to initially play the card, not to maintain it.
 - They have 3 Basic Spells with variable MP costs that can be played whenever you're able to play a Spell. These Basic Spells are **Fire**, **Blizzard**, and **Thunder**.
 - The Black Mage has a few Items that are useful for both themself and other targets. For example, Megalixir can be used to fully fill resources that have a capped minimum and maximum, similar to the Black Mage's MP, on top of healing HP.

### Version 3
 - Fixed a typo with *Swiftcast*
 - Updated how the Basic Spells *Fire*, *Blizzard*, and *Thunder* function; They're no longer considered cards.
 - Art updated.

### Version 2
 - *Ultima* and *Ultima Materia* heavily reworked; *Ultima Materia* now searches for *Ultima* from your Deck or Trash, and *Ultima* no longer needs to be the only spell you cast for two turns.
 - *Aspect Mastery* numerals nerfed from 2 to 1 and its Fire Damage buff now increases the Basic Spell Fire's costs by 1.
 - *Dream Rod* nerfed to prevent MP Costs from hitting 0.
 - *Lucid Dreaming* on the Hero Card reworked; You now choose to restore 3 MP or draw a card.
 - *Swiftcast* numerals nerfed by 1 (*Discard 2, Play 3 -> Discard 1, Play 2*). *Swiftcast* is now a Spell.
 - *Bio* MP Cost reduced from 3 to 2.
 - *Dispel* MP Cost reduced from 5 to 4.
 - *Doom* reworked; Only works on non-Character targets, counter requirement lowered from 5 to 3, and sets that target's HP to 0 once it's reached.\
 - *Drain* buffed; Heals for the damage dealt instead of a fixed 3 HP.
 - *Level 5 Death* buffed; No longer destroys, instead setting target's HP to 0.
